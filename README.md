<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Vet Clinic] <a name="about-project"></a>

**[Vet Clinic]** This is a set of instructions to create a PostgreSQL database named "vet_clinic" and a table named "animals" with columns for animal data. It also includes instructions to insert sample data into the table. The instructions also provide SQL queries to perform various tasks such as finding animals whose name ends in "mon", listing animals born between specific years, and listing animals that meet certain criteria such as being neutered or having a certain weight. These queries can be used to search and filter animal data within the table.
